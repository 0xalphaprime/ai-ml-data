    "- SVMs are supervised machine learning models used for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An SVM uses support vectors to define a decision boundary. Classifications are made by comparing unlabeled points to that decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support vectors are the points of each class closest to the decision boundary. The distance between the support vectors and the decision boundary is called the margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVMs attempt to create the largest margin possible while staying within an acceptable amount of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The C parameter controls how much error is allowed. A large C allows for little error and creates a hard margin. A small C allows for more error and creates a soft margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVMs use kernels to classify points that arenâ€™t linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kernels transform points into higher dimensional space. A polynomial kernel transforms points into three dimensions while an rbf kernel transforms points into infinite dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An rbf kernel has a gamma parameter. If gamma is large, the training data is more relevant, and as a result overfitting can occur.\n",
