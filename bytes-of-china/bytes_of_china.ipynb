    "\n",
    "10. In script.sql. Type in a query that displays the restaurant name, its address (street number and name) and telephone number. Then, click SAVE to run the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. In script.sql, write a query to get the best rating the restaurant ever received. Display the rating as best_rating. Then, click SAVE to run the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Open script.sql. Write a query to display a dish name, its price and category sorted by the dish name. Your results should have the following header:\n",
    "\n",
    "dish_name,\tprice,\tcategory\n",
    "You should get 8 rows of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Instead of sorting the results by dish name, type in a new query to display the results as follows, sorted by category name.\n",
    "\n",
    "category,\tdish_name,\tprice\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Next, type a query in script.sql that displays all the spicy dishes, their prices and category. The header should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "spicy_dish_name,   \tcategory, \tprice\n",
    "You should get 3 rows of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. In a complete menu, there will be dishes that belong to more than one category. In our sample menu, only Chicken with Brocolli is assigned to two different categories - Luncheon Specials and Chicken. How do we query the database to find dishes that span multiple categories?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use a database function, COUNT(column_name) to help us. For instance if we have a table whose non-primary key column appears multiple times in results, we can count how many times the row appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a query that displays the dish_id and COUNT(dish_id) as dish_count from the categories_dishes table. When we are displaying dish_id along with an aggregate function such as COUNT(), we have to also add a GROUP BY clause which includes dish_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Great work! Try to adjust the previous query to display only the dish(es) from the categories_dishes table which appears more than once. We can use the aggregate function, COUNT() as a condition. But instead of using the WHERE clause, we use the HAVING clause together with COUNT().\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Excellent! The previous two queries only give us a dish_id which is not very informative. We should write a better query which tells us exactly the name(s) of the dish that appears more than once in the categories_dishes table. Write a query that incorporates multiple tables that display the dish name as dish_name and dish count as dish_count.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Our last task is an improvement on Task 11 which was to display the highest rating from the review table using an aggregate function, MAX(column_name). Since the result returned only one column, it is not very informative."
